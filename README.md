# rlisp

I want to learn lisp and I want to improve my Rust. This repo is the combined effort of these two goals. It is not meant to be a production ready language by any means but it is supposed to teach me more about compilers and designing programming languages.

## Learn

One of the primary principles of this project is to **learn** which means that it should not include anything outside of the standard library in Rust. That does mean that there's going to be compatibility issues on a variety of platfroms and that's good because then, maybe, I get an opportunity to learn even more when I try and tackle these issues in the future.
